\subsection{Overview of Document}
This document will walk through the test plan for Super Mario Refactored Python,
which includes a plan for how the testing will be conducted, a system test description
which goes over the tests for functional and non-functional requirements, a plan for testing
the proof of concept, a unit testing plan and an appendix.

\section{Plan}

\subsection{Software Description}
This software is an extended re-implementation of a Super Mario Bros. clone,
written in Python.


\subsection{Test Team}
The individuals on the test team are David Jandric, Dan Noorduyn, and Alexander Samaha.



\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
\sout{We will use PyTest to test the core functionality of the project, excluding any
GUI elements (which will be tested manually). Some examples of what could be
tested automatically would be: the physics, level parsing, and collision.
Automatic testing will ensure that the major functions of the project work
correctly, and can be done quickly and efficiently. The automated testing
will cover each function in each module separately. Testing functions that require
user input will be done by automating the input.} \textcolor{red}{The overwhelming majority of our project's functionality consists of user interaction. Therefore we determined that it would be costly to create a suite of unit tests of all the base logic. Instead, our testing technique will be a manual test suite that ensures the correct responses to the user's input. If each test passes it is implied that the underlying logical functionality of our program corresponds properly.}



\subsection{Testing Tools}
The testing for this project will be done with PyTest, which is a testing suite framework for
Python projects, which deals with unit testing and code coverage.

\section{Tests for Proof of Concept}

\subsection{Movement}

During the Proof of Concept demonstration, our group demonstrated gameplay by testing a base level included in the original release. We showed how a character moves on screen in response to user input and also showed how alterations to the game files are reflected in the game.

\paragraph{Test that the game responds to user input.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{test-M1\\}}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual

Initial State: The game will be run and a base level will be loaded.

Input: Use the keyboard input KEYBOARD\_LEFT, KEYBOARD\_RIGHT and KEYBOARD\_JUMP         to move the onscreen character.

Output: The onscreen player character will be displaced according to user input.

How test will be performed: The user will push the keyboard input for the left, right and jump movements and visually confirm that the onscreen character has moved on the screen for the test to pass.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Level design}

\paragraph{Test response of changes to level.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{test-LD1\\}}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual

Initial State: The game will be run and a base level will be loaded.

Input: Use the game level files to modify the world length for a level to TEST\_LEVEL\_LENGTH.

Output: The onscreen character will move past the end of the level from the base game.

How test will be performed: By duplicating the game data for a base level and modifying the level length to one, a comparison can be made between both levels. The test passes if the character is able to move past the end of level area of the base game level.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Unit Testing Plan}
\sout{Super Refactored Mario Python will use PyTest to evaluate the functionality of each module and subsystem.}	\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}
	\sout{The project will feature unit testing files for every module created. This will help ensure the behaviour of each function is traceable to the requirements specified in the SRS. The type of testing will be dynamic and functional in nature and will involve a white box approach. Code coverage will be tracked using a PyTest plugin called PyTest-cov. The aim of unit testing in this project is to ensure a minimum of CODE\_COVERAGE\_VALUE and to instill confidence in the correctness of the game logic. Further, this test suite can be easily extended as new modules are created and set up to support automated regression testing for each future iteration of the game.}
\subsection{Unit testing of output files}
    The game does not create output files, however it does take in JSON formatted files for level design and settings options. \textcolor{red}{We will use visual confirmation methods to determine that faulty JSON files do not crash the game or cause any unwanted behaviour.} The game features a graphic user interface using PyGame. This will have to be tested manually and dynamically in a black-box fashion. As such, the development team will play the game and test user interactions with the game according to the functional requirements specified in the SRS. Visual confirmation that the behaviour of the game matches the intended behaviour will signify a pass for the test.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}

\textbf{Usability} is defined by ISO9241-11 as\\

\emph{"the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use"}.\\

As such, we want to poll users on their experience playing the game, particularly in the areas of effectiveness and satisfaction. This will help determine if we are reaching our goal of providing a better way to play the classic Super Mario Game.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Do the controls of the game make sense?
    \item Was your experience bug free? if not, where did you encounter issues?
    \item How much time do you usually play the game in one sitting? Please answer; Under 10 minutes, under 30 minutes, under 1 hour, more than 1 hour.
    \item Was the game language easy to understand?
    \item Did you enjoy your time with the game? Please rate from 1 (did not enjoy) to 5 (very much enjoyed).
    \item Would you recommend this game to a friend?
    \item Would you come back to this game instead of using a Super Mario Bros. emulator?
\end{enumerate}
