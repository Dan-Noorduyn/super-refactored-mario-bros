\maketitle

Put your introductory blurb here.

\section{Team Meeting Plan}
Need to include :  When?  Where?  Frequency?  Roles?  Rules for agendas?

Rubric:  5 marks.

\section{Team Communication Plan}

How we communicate as a team.  Git issues (through merge requests and wiki
posts?), email, group chats, phones.  What contact information is exchanged and
what is used for what information (issues through git,  updates on groupchats,
phone for meetings?)

Rubric:  3 marks.

\section{Team Member Roles}
Name  a  team  leader,  scribe.   Then  we  identify  experts  based  on  git,  
LATEX,
technology,  perhaps  domain.   Roles  are  fluid  and  you  should  know  
which  hat
you wear.

Rubric:  2 marks

\section{Git Workflow Plan}

Pretty  simple,  how  are  our  branches  organized,  is  our  repository  
centralized?
How do we label everything, how will milestones be used?

Rubric:  3 marks

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

Validate technical feasibility.  
https://sensinum.com/proof-of-concept-in-software-
development/

Identify risks, is testing going to be difficult?  what are difficult 
implementa-
tion aspects.  Are there required libraries that have some concerns (pygame and
MacOS for example).  Will portability be a concern (yes for new Macs I guess,
out  of our control but lets talk about it).

What will we demonstrate to overcome the risks.  (talk about what we might
show in terms of testing, what our product will be?  demos of levels?).

Rubric:  5  marks.   Gonna  be  a  biggie.   Maybe  we  have  a  table  here?   
some figures.

\section{Technology}

Talk  about  the  Programming  languages,  are  we  using  an  IDE?  Testing  
frame-
work,  how  are  we  testing  (maybe  something  to  do  with  pytest).   
Document
generation, how are we making documentation in Python?

Rubric:  4 marks, we need to write a bit to really bring this one out.

\section{Coding Style}

We  should  follow  a  coding  style,  this  can  involve  but  itâ€™s  important 
 that  the
code is consistent.  Someone needs to research some python coding styles.  Then
we talk about it and how it can be helpful!

Rubric:  2  marks.   Should  be  enough  to  just  introduce  the  style  and  
what
advantages it brings.

\section{Project Schedule}

Provide a pointer to your Gantt Chart.

Rubric:  5 marks.  Needs to be detailed and accurate (realistic).

\section{Project Review}

Looks like this is necessary for our revisions.

Rubric:  1 mark
