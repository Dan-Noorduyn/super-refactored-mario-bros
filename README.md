The folders and files for this project are as follows:

Doc - Documentation for the project

In order to play this game, you must have a recent version of python (version >3.6), and a version of make, to utilize the makefile.
After cloning the project with:
```shell
git clone https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/jandricd/super-refactored-mario-bros/
```

In order to install and run the game, run these commands in your terminal:
```shell
cd ./super-refactored-mario-bros/src/mariopy
make
```

After installation, you should use ```make run``` instead of ```make```.

Uninstalling the game is just as easy, and can be done by just deleting the super-mario-refactored-bros folder.
